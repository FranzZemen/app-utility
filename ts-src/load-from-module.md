# Load From Module

The @franzzemen packages often provide extensible functionality which can be defined externally and loaded dynamically.
The load-from-module module provides that capability. However, this is not a general module loader
(import () or require()). Instead it expects the external functionality to be exposed in one of several factory
patterns:

1. Load a JSON object. This is the simplest format, and pretty much just encapsulates require(jason url);
2. Load a JSON object from another package. JSON can be loaded from another package that may provide statically or
   dynamically.
3. Load a factory object to obtain a new instance. A factory is exposed either as a factory function or a constructor
   and a new instance of the object is created from those.

## Module Definition

The Module Definition specification is:

    type ModuleDefinition = {
        moduleName: string, 
        functionName?: string, 
        constructorName?: string, 
        propertyName?:string,
        moduleResolution?: string | ModuleResolution,
        validationSchema?: ValidationSchema | JSON
    };

    where:
        moduleName:  The moduleName is the name of either an installed package or a relative path, or JSON file.
        functionName:  The name of the factory function in the loaded module.  Not used for JSON files.  
        constructorName:  The name of the factory constructor in the loaded module.  Not used for JSON files or modules providing JSON properties.
        propertyName:  The name of a JSON property in the loaded module
        moduleResolution:  The module type of the loaded module. Either 'commonjs' or 'es' or a value from the enum ModuleResolution.
        validationSchema:  A schema to validate the loaded object, compliant with 'fastest-validator' schema 

Because functions, constructors and properties in the target module are accessed using the array operator [], these 
may be nested.  For example 'myFunctions.someFactoryFunction', where myFunctions is the actual export.

## Module Resolution
With the advent of support for ES modules, module resolution specification becomes important, whereas prior to this
commonjs was assumed. ES modules cannot dynamically import from other modules without becoming asynchronous, through the
import() build in method. CommonJS modules can can be imported synchronously via require/createRequire from either.

Rather than try and parse the outcome, a module resolution specification is required for ES modules to be loaded. If it
is missing or a commonjs specification, commonjs is assumed. Thus loading from a module anything but JSON will convert
processing to asynchronous if the target is an ES module.

### Relative Paths
Because ultimately require or import() will be used, moduleName is an installed package, a URL, an absolute path, or it
is relative to the location of the @franzzemen/app-utility/load-from-module.js module, per node standard. Since most of
the time one would be using relative paths from a given package, the relative path would normally begin with '../../../'
to travel back to app-utility then to @franzzemen and finally out of the top node_modules folder.

For relative paths, it is important to remember that if you let your node packages fall out of sync, you may end up with
@franzzemen packages in nested node_module folders. Either a) keep your packages will updated or only import the top
most @franzzemen package you need that itself will install @franzzemen/app-utility, OR don't use relative paths.  
Otherwise, depending on which node_modules is used by the package loader, your relative paths may not be right. 

## Loading JSON

      loadJSONResource(relativePath, check?: ValidationSchema | CheckFunction, ec?: ExecutionContextI): Object | Promise<Object>

      where:
         relativePath: The path to the JSON, any path allowable for this by Node is acceptable.  See Relative Paths above
         check: Either a schema which will be compiled in the function, or a compiled CheckFunction (presumably cached)
         ec: The execution context

This is simply a wrapper to require (obtained through createRequire), returning the JSON object.  

If a validation schema has been provided, and that schema is marked for asynchronous validation, a Promise to the JSON 
object is returned.  The same holds true if a CheckFunction is provided and it is an AsyncCheckFunction.  An exception is 
thrown if the object cannot be loaded or if it doesn't validate (with appropriate logging).

From a security perspective, validation is not as critical as when loanding an object from a factory function, because 
the returned object is stringified and parsed, which will only result in non-functional properties.

## Loading JSON From Module Factory Function

      loadJSONFromPackage(moduleDef: ModuleDefinition, check?: CheckFunction, ec?: ExecutionContextI): Object | Promise<Object>

      where:
         moduleDef:  the ModuleDefinition, which may include a validation schema
         check: A validation check function, presumably externally cached and much faster than schema
         ec: The xecution context
         

If a factory function 'functionName' is specified the propertyName will be ignored.  In this case, the function will 
be retrieved and called to get the object.  The factory function must not be asynchronous (must not return a Promise).

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The returned JSON from the factory function is expected to be a **string**, not an object! Parsing 
is done by this package, to avoid this function being abused.

As mentioned, if moduleResolution is 'es' for the target module, the code will transition to asynchronous, and 
return a Promise.  You will therefore need to be able to handle promises or make a decision that your modules will 
always be 'commonjs' and throw an error on Promise.

Because validations can be asynchronous, a Promise can also be returned in that case.

The moduleDefinition can contain a validation schema.  If check is also provided, the CheckFunction will be used 
for validation, otherwise the schema (if it is provided) will be used.

From a security perspective, validation is not as critical as when loading an object from a factory function, because
the returned value from the function is a string and parsed after it is obtained.

### Object Instance Factory

      loadFromModule<T>(moduleDef: ModuleDefinition, paramsArray?: any[], check?: CheckFunction, ec?: ExecutionContextI): Promise<T> | T 
      where:
         mdouleDef: The ModuleDefinition, which may include a validation schema
         paramsArray:  An array of parameters to provide the factory function on constructor (the array will be spread with the spread operator ...).
         check: A validation check function, presumably externally cached and much faster than schema
         ec: The xecution context

This loads the target module and creates a new instance, using either the factory function or constructor supplied.  If
the function name is provided, the constructor name will be ignored.  The factory function  must not be asynchronous (must not 
return a Promise).

If the loaded module is of type 'es', or if any validation is asynchronous, a Promise will be returned.

The moduleDefinition can contain a validation schema.  If check is also provided, the CheckFunction will be used
for validation, otherwise the schema (if it is provided) will be used.

From a security perspective, providing validation (schema or CheckFunction) is recommended.
